    SMACSS-style categorization of its CSS rules:

    Base — CSS reset/normalize plus HTML element styling.
    Layout — macro arrangement of a web page, including any grid systems.
    Component — discrete, reusable UI elements.
    State — styles that deal with client-side changes to components.
    Theme — purely visual styling (“look-and-feel”) for a component.
